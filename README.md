# VBA_Challenge
For this challenge we were to use the skills we learned to create a VBA script to run a stock analysis. This script is saved as a text document that can be copied and pasted into the workbooks VBA environment. This script was designed to act on the specific University of Pennsylvania Data Science Bootcamp Excel workbook provided to us. 
The script was created in collaboration with my peers Kiet Hoang, Mike Pointek, Patrick Dean, Katie Ballinger, Jordan Underwood, Victoria, Martin-Nelson and Sarah Schilling.
Previous code was used as guidance from https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/stock-analysis.git to develop my code for this VBA script.
I also referenced https://github.com/cmac18/Analysis-of-Stock-Market-Data.git to develop this VBA script.
Open AI, via ChatGPT 3.5 was used to help debug my code as well as provide spellcheck. 
The code was added to the above GitHub repository.
